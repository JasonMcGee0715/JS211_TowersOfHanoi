Towers of Hanoi

Move a piece-
    pop from one column to another

legal move- 
    smallest piece is 1
    biggest piece is  4
    base is           0

    so to make a legal move the base has to be less than the piece your moving.  This makes it always put a smaller piece
    on top of a bigger piece.  The biggest piece would = 1 and the base would = 0.

check for win-
    This function should run after every move.  It should also compare a winning set (array) to the current set (array).  If it 
    matches, then you win and a alert pops up notifying user.  If not, then it allows next move.
